Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for FileNet.

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.  
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector for FileNet provides access to documents and document
metadata stored in the FileNet Content Manager developed by the
IBM Corporation.

The connector communicates with the FileNet Content Manager using the
IBM FileNet Content Manager Java API. The Content Manager Java API is
a commercial product from the IBM Corporation and is not included in
this distribution.
